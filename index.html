        <h3>Pirates of the carabian: The Curse of the Black Pearl</h3>
        <p>Pirates of the carabian: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a great movie that continued out 4 more times, all of which being good, These movies have a lot of action, a few comedy skits and a good, followable story line, plus a few real life "connections" like the disease on the side of jacks face that gets worse every movie</p> <br />
        <h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
        <p>Like pirates of the carabian, almost all the marvel movies are good, but Deadpool and Wolverine may take the top because of how much constain comedy is in it, paired with the action</p>
        <h3>The Iron Giant</h3>
        <p>The Iron Giant is my favorite cartoon, It had a good story, the giant was a easy character to connect to, it had a few comidy bit but also went in a sad direction, It was just a greate movie, i like it so much that if i could only watch one movie for the rest of my life i would probably pick The Iron Giant, unfortunately brad bird stated that there will never be a second one</p>
